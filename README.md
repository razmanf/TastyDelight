Vincent Restaurant is a dynamic full-stack website developed as part of the ‘Server – Side Programming’ module university assignment. Designed with a user-friendly interface and quick navigation between pages, it combines online food ordering and table reservation functionalities for customers looking for a seamless and efficient food ordering experience from their restaurant of choice. Built with PHP and Node.js for backend logic, MySQL for database management, and Tailwind CSS for a responsive frontend, it enables features like order tracking, user and admin authentication, and menu management. Hosted on XAMPP, the project demonstrates practical integration of modern web technologies to deliver a smooth, interactive experience for administrators and users.
